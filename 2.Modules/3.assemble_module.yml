## Assemble allows configuration files to be broken into segments and concatenated to form a destination file
## Great to use, when an application or tool, requires its configuration as a single file, but you wish to manage it as separate entities

# Here conf.d contains 2 configuration files. and we are using the assemble module to combine both of them into one config file (sshd_config)
