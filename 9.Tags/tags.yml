## Tags allows us to run a specific tasks
# eg: ansible-playbook tags.yml --tags "restart_nginx" -> this will only run the Restart nginx task

## We can skip the tasks using tags
# ansible-playbook tags.yml --skip-tags "restart_nginx"

## By default all tags belong under all tag
# ansible-playbook tags.yml --tags all -> This will run all the tasks

## We can provide tags to entire playbooks
# But doing this may not run the gather_facts as it has an inbuilt tag known as always ( To overcome this we can create an empty play inside a playbook)

## We can provide 'always' tag to certain tasks (same as gather_facts) This will run the task no matter you called the tag or not

### SPECIAL TAGS

## tagged -> ansible-playbook tags.yml --tags "tagged" -> This will run all the tagged tasks/plays

## untagged -> opposite of above

## all -> runs all tasks
