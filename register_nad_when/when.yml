 - hosts: all
   tasks:
     - name: Usage of when
       command: hostname -s
       register: op
       when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"

## Only prints the output if there is any change     
     - debug:
         var: op
      #when: op.changed
       when: op is changed

# both the above method is correct

# Can also use - when: op is skipped. This will perform the task only on the skipped hosts
